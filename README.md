# TotalSegmentator Horos Plugin (WIP)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress**: this repository hosts an evolving prototype of the *TotalSegmentator* plugin for Horos. We are validating the integration, refining the UI, and tuning the post-processing workflow. Expect frequent changes, unstable APIs, and partially implemented features.

---

## Overview

This project brings the [TotalSegmentator](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator) pipeline into Horos/OsiriX via a native plugin. It exports the active series, launches the segmentation in Python (nnUNet/TotalSegmentator), re-imports the outputs as RT-Struct, and reapplies the ROIs to the current Horos viewer.

The repository still ships the official TotalSegmentator sources (`totalsegmentator/`) because the plugin reuses internal scripts and helpers, but the primary focus of this fork is the Horos plugin.

---

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ End-to-end export ‚Üí segmentation ‚Üí import flow works for 2D CT/MR series.
- ‚úÖ Isolated Python environment bootstrapped under `~/Library/Application Support/TotalSegmentatorHorosPlugin`.
- ‚úÖ RT-Struct overlays applied to the active viewer (Horos ‚â• 4.0.1 required).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration UI is minimal; advanced class selection is still limited.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Horos must be running in English to avoid localization issues in menus.
- üöß Automated tests and formal distribution (installer `.pkg`) are not yet available.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or newer (validated on macOS 15.0.1).
- Horos 4.0.1 (build 20231016) or compatible OsiriX-based host.
- Xcode 15/16+ with Swift 5 toolchain.
- Python 3.9 or 3.13 available (the plugin provisions its own virtualenv).
- Optional GPU; CPU mode works but is faster with `--fast`.

## Quick Build & Install

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TotalSegmentator.git
   cd TotalSegmentator
   ```

2. **Build the plugin**
   ```bash
   xcodebuild \
     -project MyOsiriXPluginFolder-Swift/TotalSegmentatorHorosPlugin.xcodeproj \
     -configuration Release \
     -target TotalSegmentatorHorosPlugin \
     build
   ```

3. **Install into Horos**
   ```bash
   PLUGIN_SRC="MyOsiriXPluginFolder-Swift/build/Release/TotalSegmentatorHorosPlugin.osirixplugin"
   PLUGIN_DST="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Horos/Plugins/"

   rm -rf "$PLUGIN_DST/TotalSegmentatorHorosPlugin.osirixplugin"
   cp -R "$PLUGIN_SRC" "$PLUGIN_DST"
   codesign --force --deep --sign - "$PLUGIN_DST/TotalSegmentatorHorosPlugin.osirixplugin"
   ```

4. **Launch Horos** and confirm the entry under `Plugins ‚ñ∏ Plugin Manager ‚ñ∏ TotalSegmentator`.

---

## Using the Plugin in Horos

1. Open a study and ensure the active series is 2D (CT or MR).
2. Choose `Plugins ‚ñ∏ TotalSegmentator ‚ñ∏ Run TotalSegmentator`.
3. Adjust the basic settings (task, device, output) and press **Run**.
4. Watch the progress window. On success the plugin:
   - imports the generated DICOM files,
   - builds the RT-Struct objects,
   - applies the ROIs to the active viewer.

> **Tip:** to transfer RT-Struct to another workstation, export the newly imported objects from Horos after the segmentation finishes.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Common Cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plugin missing from menu | Bundle not copied/signed correctly | Re-run installation steps and check permissions |
| ‚Äúrt_utils‚Äù missing error | Python dependency absent | Execute `~/Library/.../PythonEnvironment/bin/pip install rt_utils` |
| No ROIs applied | RT-Struct failed to load | Inspect `Window ‚ñ∏ Logs ‚ñ∏ TotalSegmentator` and ensure a 2D series is open |
| Python env corrupted | Interrupted during virtualenv setup | Delete `~/Library/Application Support/TotalSegmentatorHorosPlugin` and run the plugin again |

---

## Development Notes

- Core plugin logic: `MyOsiriXPluginFolder-Swift/Plugin.swift`.
- Interface files (XIB): `Settings.xib`, `RunSegmentationWindowController.xib`.
- Python helpers (bridge, converters): generated on the fly in the plugin‚Äôs temporary workspace.

### Coding Guidelines
- Swift 5 with `swift-format` where available.
- Comments only for non-obvious blocks; emphasize readable implementation.
- Avoid adding extra bundled dependencies‚Äîreuse Horos frameworks whenever possible.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Advanced preferences panel with class selection via TotalSegmentator API.
- [ ] Support volumetric multi-frame series and MPR viewers.
- [ ] Automate packaging as `.pkg` with pre-provisioned Python environment.
- [ ] Add smoke-test harness that triggers the plugin headlessly.
